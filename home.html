    <h1>C# Language</h1>    
    <p>C# syntax is highly expressive, yet it is also simple and easy to learn. The curly-brace syntax of C# will be instantly recognizable to anyone familiar with C, C++ or Java. Developers who know any of these languages are typically able to begin to work productively in C# within a very short time. C# syntax simplifies many of the complexities of C++ and provides powerful features such as nullable value types, enumerations, delegates, lambda expressions and direct memory access, which are not found in Java. C# supports generic methods and types, which provide increased type safety and performance, and iterators, which enable implementers of collection classes to define custom iteration behaviors that are simple to use by client code. Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) expressions make the strongly-typed query a first-class language construct.    
    </p>    
    <p>    
     As an object-oriented language, C# supports the concepts of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. All variables and methods, including the Main method, the application's entry point, are encapsulated within class definitions. A class may inherit directly from one parent class, but it may implement any number of interfaces. Methods that override virtual methods in a parent class require the override keyword as a way to avoid accidental redefinition. In C#, a struct is like a lightweight class; it is a stack-allocated type that can implement interfaces but does not support inheritance.

   This is <strong>important</strong>. It <strong>really is important. <strong>And this is even more important!</strong></strong>
   I can <em>not</em> emphasise this enough!
   <p>A million stars up in the sky<br>    
    one shines brighter I can't deny<br>    
    A love so precious a love so true<br>    
    a love that comes from me to you<br>    
    The angels sing when you are near<br>    
    within your arms, I have nothing to fear<br>    
    You always know just what to say <br>    
    just talking to you makes my day<br>    
    I love you, honey, with all of my heart<br>    
    together forever and never to part.
